                <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is 
                extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight
                language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of
                different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment(a web broswer
                or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide
                programmatic control over them.

                            <span class="underline">Variable Delaration</span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing
                            data values - image a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds
                            a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names
                            are called identifiers. <span class="purple">var x;</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            <span class="underline">Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript
                            variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment 
                            operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="purple">var x = 10;</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            <span class="underline">Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate 
                            on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript
                             primitives: Boolean - <span class="purple">true</span> or <span class="purple">false;</span> null - 
                             <span class="purple">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="purple">42</span> or <span class="purple">3.14159;</span>
                              String - <span class="purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="purple">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> 
                              and Object - <span class="purple">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            <span class="underline">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different
                            decisions - hitting different code blocks based on valus or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional 
                            statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following coditional statements: <span class="purple">if</span> 
                            a specified condition is true, do this code in our code blocks; <span class="purple">else if</span> to specify a new
                             condition to test, if the first codition is false; <span class="purple">else</span> we execute this block of code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            <span class="underline">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all 
                            essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile,
                            well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            <span class="underline">Function</span> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will
                            run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from
                            Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table
                            the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our
                            function over and over again.
