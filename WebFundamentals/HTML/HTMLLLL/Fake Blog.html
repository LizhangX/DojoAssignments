            <h1>A Short Introduction of Dim Sum</h1>
            <p> 
                Dim Sum is a style of Chinese cuisine (particularly Cantonese but also other varieties) 
                prepared as small bite-sized portions of food served in small steamer baskets or on small plates. 
                Dim sum dishes are usually served with tea, and together form a full tea brunch. 
                Dim sum traditionally are served as fully cooked, ready-to-serve dishes. In Cantonese teahouses, 
                carts with dim sum will be served around the restaurant for diners to order from without leaving 
                their seats. the Cantonese tradition of having endless cups of tea and dim sum is also called Yum Cha.
